Repository for client-side application prototypes

The repository contains a number of simple websites exploring various client-side technologies and frameworks.
Any data saved is done using a connection to Firebase.

New client-side projects are added to the ./projects sub-folder.

Currently, the following projects are available:
- Team Potluck (interactive list example using Firebase, Angular, and Bootstrap)
- Random Key Generator (simple client-side web page leveraging Bootstrap/Bootswatch allowing a user paramaterize and generate random strings of characters)
- Shell of an Bootstrap / AngularJS site
- Shell of a jQuery Mobile site
